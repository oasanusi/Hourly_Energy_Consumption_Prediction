# Springboard_capstone_project_1
As part of Springboard's Data Science career track this repo contains files and jupyter notebooks related to my first
capstone- predicting energy consumption based on past hourly energy consumption data in a region in US. The region
chosen was the utility regions under CAISO (California Independent System Operator), and specifically the SDGE (San Diego Gas and Electric)
region will be focused upon for building the prediction model. 

#### File descriptions:
###### Capstone Project 1_ Data Wrangling.docx 
Contains the basic data import and cleaning steps carried out on the hourly data from CAISO
###### Capstone1_CAISO_hourly_energy_import&clean_data.ipynb
Contains the code for importing the data directly from CAISO's website; also includes data cleaning.
###### Capstone_SDGE_hourly_energy_data_exploration.ipynb
Contains basic data exploration on the cleaned data; focusing on San Diego region for now
