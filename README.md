# Springboard_capstone_project_1
As part of Springboard's Data Science career track this repo contains files and jupyter notebooks related to my first
capstone- predicting energy consumption based on past hourly energy consumption data in a region in US. The region
chosen was the utility regions under CAISO (California Independent System Operator), and specifically the SDGE (San Diego Gas and Electric)
region will be focused upon for building the prediction model.
