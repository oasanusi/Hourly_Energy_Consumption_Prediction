# Springboard_capstone_project_1
As part of Springboard's Data Science career track this repo contains files and jupyter notebooks related to my first
capstone- predicting energy consumption based on past hourly energy consumption data for a region in US. The region chosen was the utility regions under CAISO (California Independent System Operator), and specifically the SDGE (San Diego Gas and Electric) region was focused upon for building the prediction model. 

#### File descriptions:
###### capstone1_project_proposal.docx
Contains the project proposal 
###### Capstone Project 1_ Data Wrangling.docx 
Contains the basic data import and cleaning steps carried out on the hourly energy consumption data from CAISO
###### Capstone1_CAISO_hourly_energy_import&clean_data.ipynb (moved to Archive)
Contains the code for importing the data directly from CAISO's website; also includes data cleaning.
###### Capstone_SDGE_hourly_energy_data_exploration.ipynb (moved to Archive)
Contains basic data exploration on the cleaned data; focusing on San Diego region for now
###### Capstone_SDGE_hourly_energy_statistical_analysis.ipynb (moved to Archive)
Merging the energy data with weather and PV installations data and doing some basic data explorations and statistical analysis

###### Capstone1_SDGE_hourly_energy_milestone.ipynb
A single notebook file including data import of energy, weather and PV installation data files, Exploring the data files, doing statistical analysis, finding trends among energy, weather and PV installated capacity data.
